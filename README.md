# MCRetroAuth
A third party authentication server for Minecraft and Minecraft launchers. This project is provided without any support.

The goal is to support the current authentication scheme, and the old legacy authentication formats.
The protocol specifications I used to create this can be found here:

 - [Legacy Authentication](https://wiki.vg/Legacy_Authentication)
 - [Modern Authentication](https://wiki.vg/Authentication)

If possible I would also like to allow old Minecraft launchers and old minecraft versions to work with the current authentication system.
Currently there is no plans to support the Microsoft Authentication Scheme, however support may be added later.
